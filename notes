there needs to be an object keeping track of turn events

this object would contain:
 . number of cards scrapped during the turn


A turn needs to have a "clean up" phase
    Perhaps this can be a collection of actions that are run sequentially at the end of a turn?
With sequential actions, can the turn be played normally between actions?
